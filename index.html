                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>Hi there!</p>
                    <p>My name is kunlin li, and have been a full-time frontend developer for about 5 years.</p>
                    <p>
                        In my past jobs, I usually processed kinds of tasks about toB project, have many experience on
                        communicating with upstream and downstream colleagues and finding out the user demand, and thus finding
                        the final solution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm familiar with the modern necessary knowledge about frontend, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                        TypeScript, Vue, Angular and more. Since we need do some co-working frequently, network and
                        some backend knowledge are also in my brain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Besides, cause the experience of pixi.js, paper.js, things which are related to code will interest me.
                        I think it can take more possibilities to frontend and make your websites more attractive. So, CSS Animation,
                        Canvas Animation and related knowledge are something I'm going deep into recently.
